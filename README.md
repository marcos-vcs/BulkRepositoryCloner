### Motivation
This project was developed to solve a personal need to clone several repositories at once in a practical and simplified way. After automating this I decided to share the code of this automation with everyone who needs to do the same.

---
### Operation
clone and this repository and change the branch to Publish using the command "git checkout Publish" then just run the .exe file in the location where the repository is.

#### Questions or suggestions?
Feel free to open a new issue.
